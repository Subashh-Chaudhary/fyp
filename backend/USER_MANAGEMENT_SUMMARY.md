# Crop Disease Detection System - User Management Summary

## System Overview

The Crop Disease Detection System implements a comprehensive user management system with three distinct user types, each serving specific roles in the agricultural ecosystem.

## User Types & Roles

### 1. Admin (System Administrator)

- **Purpose**: Full system access and management
- **Creation**: Pre-configured, no registration required
- **Default Credentials**:
  - Email: `admin@cropdisease.com`
  - Password: `admin123`
- **Permissions**:
  - Manage all users (farmers and experts)
  - Access system analytics and reports
  - Manage disease database
  - System configuration and maintenance

### 2. Plant Doctor (Expert)

- **Purpose**: Agricultural experts providing disease diagnosis and treatment advice
- **Creation**: Through unified registration form
- **Key Features**:
  - Specialization tracking
  - Experience and qualifications
  - License verification
  - Availability status
  - Rating system
  - Case tracking

### 3. Farmer (End User)

- **Purpose**: Agricultural producers submitting disease queries
- **Creation**: Through unified registration form
- **Key Features**:
  - Farm information tracking
  - Crop preferences
  - Location data
  - Query history

## Database Architecture

### Core Tables

1. **Users Table** (Common fields for all user types)
   - Basic information (name, email, password, phone, address)
   - User type classification (farmer, expert, admin)
   - Authentication fields (verification, reset tokens)
   - Social login support

2. **Experts Table** (Extended fields for plant doctors)
   - Professional information (specialization, experience, qualifications)
   - License and availability tracking
   - Performance metrics (rating, case count)

3. **Farmers Table** (Extended fields for farmers)
   - Farm details (size, type, location)
   - Crop preferences
   - Agricultural context

## Registration Flow

### Unified Registration Process

1. **Single Endpoint**: `POST /register`
2. **Request Structure**:

   ```json
   {
     "name": "string",
     "email": "string",
     "password": "string",
     "phone": "string (optional)",
     "address": "string (optional)",
     "user_type": "farmer" | "expert",
     "expert_profile": {
       "specialization": "string",
       "experience_years": "number",
       "qualifications": "string",
       "license_number": "string"
     },
     "farmer_profile": {
       "farm_size": "number",
       "farm_type": "string",
       "preferred_crops": ["string"]
     }
   }
   ```

3. **Registration Logic**:
   - Validates user type (farmer or expert only)
   - Checks email uniqueness
   - Creates user record with hashed password
   - Creates type-specific profile based on user_type
   - Returns user and profile data

## Key Implementation Features

### 1. Type-Safe Architecture

- Strong typing with TypeScript
- Enum-based user roles
- Validated DTOs for all inputs
- Proper error handling

### 2. Security Implementation

- Password hashing with bcrypt
- JWT-based authentication
- Role-based access control
- Input validation and sanitization

### 3. Scalable Design

- Modular architecture with separate modules
- Repository pattern for data access
- Service layer for business logic
- Controller layer for API endpoints

### 4. Standardized Responses

- Consistent API response format
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Error handling with meaningful messages
- Pagination support

## API Endpoints

### Authentication

- `POST /register` - Unified registration

- `POST /auth/verify-email` - Email verification

### User Management

- `GET /users` - List all users (admin only)
- `GET /users/type/:type` - Get users by type
- `GET /users/statistics` - Get user statistics
- `GET /user/:id` - Get specific user
- `PATCH /user/:id` - Update user
- `DELETE /user/:id` - Delete user

### Expert Management

- `GET /experts` - List all experts
- `GET /experts/available` - Get available experts
- `GET /experts/profile` - Get current expert profile
- `PUT /experts/profile` - Update expert profile
- `PUT /experts/availability` - Update availability
- `GET /experts/:id` - Get expert by ID

### Farmer Management

- `GET /farmers` - List all farmers
- `GET /farmers/profile` - Get current farmer profile
- `PUT /farmers/profile` - Update farmer profile
- `GET /farmers/statistics` - Get farmer statistics
- `GET /farmers/by-farm-type/:farmType` - Get farmers by farm type
- `GET /farmers/by-crop/:crop` - Get farmers by preferred crop
- `GET /farmers/:id` - Get farmer by ID

## Business Logic Highlights

### 1. Unified Registration

- Single endpoint handles both farmer and expert registration
- Type-specific validation and profile creation
- Automatic user type assignment
- Email uniqueness validation

### 2. Profile Management

- Separate profile tables for experts and farmers
- Type-specific fields and validation
- Relationship management with main users table
- Cascading deletes for data integrity

### 3. Statistics and Analytics

- User count by type
- Expert availability tracking
- Farmer farm type distribution
- Performance metrics for experts

### 4. Search and Filtering

- Find experts by specialization
- Find farmers by crop preferences
- Filter by farm type
- Location-based queries (framework ready)
